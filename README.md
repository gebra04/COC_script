# COC_script
This Script is an automation of attacks for Clash of Clans and does not uses AI.
There are 5 options of attacks, 3 in the constructor base and 2 in the main base.
After you choose your attack, you choose how many attacks you'll execute.

## Main Base
You can choose between Dragon or Goblin attack, and which of your heroes you'll use in the attack. The 2 first heroes Goes with the army, and the last 2 goes in split in different sides.
### The Army
The pre set army is order:
- Dragon (event)
- Dragons
- (Barraca)
- Heroes (in the order explained)
- Rage

## Constructor Base
You can choose between Win(1), Lose(2), Hybrid(3). You also can choose between 2 or 1 town attack and how much attacks until you collect the elixir.
### Upgrades Ideas
Further I'll also implement selecting the heroes (or not) because the timing beetween the abilities are different.
